   * Tests focusing on overlapping highlights
   * Procedure:
   * [1] Load fixture named: params.fixturePrefix + '.' + params.fixturePostfixBeforeFocus (fixture with highlight id 2 in focus) and set that to the root element.
   * [3] Focus on highlight using params.ids[0].
   * [4] Ensure the innermost highlight wrapper for the text nodes in the highlight range are for params.id[0] [2].
   * [5] Focus on a second ID using params.ids[1] if it exists (this is the highlight that was originally focused in the params.fixturePostfixBeforeFocus)
   * [6] Ensure the innermost highlight wrapper for the text nodes in the highlight range are for params.id[1] [1].
   *
   * @typedef Highlight
   * @type {object}
   * @property {string} id
   * @property {number} offset
   * @property {number} length
   *
   * @param params
   * @param {string} params.title - test title
   * @param {Highlight[]} params.highlights - The unique identifier for collections of highlight elements representing the same highlight that we are to focus on.
   * @param {string} params.fixturePrefix - fixture name prefix
   * @param {string} params.fixturePostfixBeforeFocus - fixture name postfix used as the before focus comparison
